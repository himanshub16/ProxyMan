## ProxyMan [![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

```
This project is no longer maintained.
Back in 2015-2017, configuring proxy settings was a pain on Linux due to too many configuration files.
Recent versions of Ubuntu tend to work quite well, and most other apps can use the system settings UI.
For other cases, you are free to use this tool.

### Configuring proxy made so simple on Linux ([releases](https://github.com/himanshub16/ProxyMan/releases/))


v3 is ready with new features, necessary improvements, updates, restructured code and much better experience. :tada:

* Download and install with single-step process.
```./install```

Proxyman is now available in your path. 
Open a new terminal window and start playing.

* Set proxy
```proxyman set```

* Save your settings for later use.
* View your saved configs
```proxyman configs```
* Load your previously saved config - say you saved it by the name *point4*. 
```proxyman load point4```

## What's new?
* Saved configs made more organized and works flawlessly.
* Installation script makes it available in your path. Just call the command `proxyman`, no `cd` to your downloads.
* Lots of issues got closed.
* Restructured codebase with better code quality than before - easier to maintain.
