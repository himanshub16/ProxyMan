### Configuring proxy made so simple on Linux ([releases](https://github.com/himanshub16/ProxyMan/releases/))


v3 is ready with new features, necessary improvements, updates, restructured code and much better experience. :tada: 

## How to use it now
* Download and install with single-step process.
```./install```

Proxyman is now available in your path. 
Open a new terminal window and start playing.

* Set proxy
```proxyman set```

* Save your settings for later use.
* View your saved configs
```proxyman configs```
* Load your previously saved config - say you saved it by the name *point4*. 
```proxyman load point4```

## What's new?
* Saved configs made more organized and works flawlessly.
* Installation script makes it available in your path. Just call the command `proxyman`, no `cd` to your downloads.
* Lots of issues got closed.
* Restructured codebase with better code quality than before - easier to maintain.


## Why still a release candidate?
Just letting it be for about a month from now to let me use it and find more bugs and edge cases (if any). :see_no_evil: 
If you find one, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/ProxyMan/issues).
Would release during the first week of 2019. :smiley:
