#
# plugin to set "TARGET ENVIRON" proxy settings for ProxyMan
#
# The arguments are given in bash syntax to maintain universality and ease
# across all UNIX systems. 
# Your language can use it's respective syntax for 
# arguments and comments.
# If you don't need any particular proxy settings, ignore the variables.

# $#  : number of arguments 
# $1  : http_host 
# if this argument is "unset", proxy settings should be unset.
# if this is "toggle", simply toggle current settings.

# $2  : http_port 
# $3  : use_same ; "yes" or "no"
# $4  : use_auth 
# $5  : username ; send empty string if not available 
# $6  : password ; send empty string if not available 
# 
# if use same is yes, then no further arguments are considered
# 
# $7  : https_host 
# $8  : https_port 
# $9  : ftp_host 
# $10 : ftp_port 

# below settings are removed as of now
# reason : they are generally not required in daily use
# and some applications (like whatsapp web) are not comfortable
# with them.
# also, handling them requires rework on certain areas.
#
# most applications do follow http proxy
## $11 : socks_host 
## $12 : socks_port 
## $13 : rsync_host 
## $14 : rsync_port
